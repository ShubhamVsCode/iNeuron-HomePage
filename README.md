I want to mention that it took me 55 hours to complete this project. I didn't want to be in a hurry because I wanted to think creatively over it and make a good-looking fantastic website for this hackathon. I would like to thank Hitesh Sir for bringing this platform findcoder.io and the opportunity to present my skills from this hackathon.
